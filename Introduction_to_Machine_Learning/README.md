#### Introduction to Machine Learning
We will take a fast-paced, practical, and pragmatic approach to explaining Machine Learning. 
First, we'll explore common types of Machine Learning, supervised learning vs unsupervised learning, and how they differ from each other. Next, you'll get clear on the most important jargon and terminology you need to know. Finally, We'll then cover the steps of developing a Machine Learning application.
